IMPORTANT: RESTART THE FLASK SERVER

The appointment cancellation feature has been updated.

To apply the changes:

1. Stop the Flask server (Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. Start it again:
   cd backend_flask
   python app.py

3. The cancel appointment endpoint is now available at:
   POST /api/patient/appointments/<appointment_id>/cancel

The changes made:
- Backend route accepts both POST and PUT methods
- Frontend uses POST method
- Cancellation updates status to 'cancelled' in database
- Changes reflect everywhere (patient dashboard, doctor dashboard)

After restarting, the cancel button should work properly!
